  This is what I looked like as an undergraduate:

In that time, I was learning Industrial Design in an art school.           

That is what I look like now:

Nowadays, I'm trying to become a pro programmer, which is very different with my initial major. It took me lots of courage to make this decision and thanks for Thoughtworks providing us such an opportunity to learn code with the help from the coaches and the buddies. It gives me more motivation and capability than learning by myself. Hope we can make progress together!!!!!!

To be continue...
